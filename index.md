Hello, I'm Nathan. I was born and raised here in San Diego but I'm half Russian. I'm a sophomore at Del Norte and my biggest passion is gymnastics. I'm looking to pursure Gymnastics in college as a D1 athlete but I haven't really started to look yet. I want to pursure a carreer in entrepreneurship and technology, a combination of the both, however I haven't made a complete decision just yet. I value my education and I know that a background of computer science is very good skill to have for any field I decide to go into relating technology and software.
